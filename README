Note: A Pubkey has been added in U:\.ssh that connects to my remote repository
at UIUC. It's password is the same as the biomed1 account as of 7/27/2017. For security
reasons, I will disable its use when I leave Riverside.  If you wish to receive
updates on this toolkit, please contact me, and I will temporarily reenable it.
A Github repository may be created in the near future for public access to
avoid the need for these measures.
